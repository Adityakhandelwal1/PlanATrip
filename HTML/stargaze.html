<p style="column-count:1;word-spacing:3px;line-height:1.8">Space outside the human living capacity has always been one of the greatest mysteries of our lives.

We start by being toddlers that stare into open space, mouths and ears open to absorb everything and anything. We ask our parents questions for which answers they cannot create. Not more than their own imagination takes them.
School teaches us innumerable names and we excite ourselves and others by adding to the seemingly vast knowledge we have gained.
We live on to being young lovers who lie on grassy hilltops staring at those magical twinkling beauties. We kiss under the stars and live on to become the wiser ones who know a little more of the pieces in the jigsaw by being able to name the more than a few constellations right, and by being able to understand what all these sci-fi movies are constantly trying to put across. Those who can, will throw their imagination in the right places and trying to give a face to  what the unknown may be. (Speaking of all the movies we know).

But we never know enough. And the outer space in all its notoriety constantly reminds us of how tiny we are. How insignificant in its comparison.</p>
