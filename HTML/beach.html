<p style="column-count:1;word-spacing:3px;line-height:1.8">Another New Year,&nbsp; another reason to explore the world. Last time I had international tours on my mind but this year, I&rsquo;m sorting through the best beaches in our country to kick back and relax. Scattered all over India&rsquo;s 7500-kilometre long coastline, here are the top 10 beaches that will leave you surprised and satisfied with India&rsquo;s coastal beauty.</p>
<h2  >
	1. Goa</h2>

<p  >
	When in doubt, go Goa!&nbsp; One cannot really go wrong with India&rsquo;s party capital. A place where people can be seen sunbathing, swimming, parasailing or relaxing in their hammocks sipping a cold beer all year round, Goa is my first pick. In fact, Goa is the best place to kick-start your beach blast in advance with Sunburn Goa this December! Sunburn is when a conglomerate of party mongers and DJs from all over the world get together at the Candolim beach for the grandest New Year beach party. Late night parties, hypnotic music and people dancing away; Sunburn exponentially increases the fun quotient.</p>

<h2  >
	2. Gokarna, Karnataka</h2>
<p  >

<p  >
	Gokarna in Karnataka is situated 190 kilometres south of Goa and makes for a wonderful change from Goa&rsquo;s fast pace! Famous for the Mahabaleshwar temple and its pristine beaches, in this tranquil town, you can enjoy a day basking in the sun or laying in a hammock reading a book without distractions. Gokarna is well-connected to major cities through buses and <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com/routeplanner/goa-gokarna.html" target="_blank">trains</a> and the closest airport is <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com/flights/goa-flight-tickets.html" target="_blank">Dabolim Airport in Goa. </a>&nbsp;Though an important pilgrimage site, Gokarna blends religion with beach fun. Om Beach, Paradise Beach and Half-Moon Beach are the famous ones, which have both fine sand and rocky coasts mostly untouched by commercial activities.</p>
<h2  >
	3. Ganpatipule, Maharashtra</h2>
<p  >

<p  >
	A tiny coastal town in Maharashtra, Ganpatipule has a grand beach, one of the most spectacular on the Konkan coast. The beach has distinctive red sand and shallow water, making it ideal for swimming. Ganpatipule can be visited en route to Ratnagiri and is just 35 kilometres from the famous Jaigad Fort, which offers a panoramic view of the sea and villages from the cliff. Ganpatipule is also famous for the Swaymbhu Ganesh temple where Lord Ganesh&rsquo;s statue is believed to have originated from the ground.</p>
<p  >
<strong>Try Out: </strong>Pick up a packet of delicious Ambapoli and Phanspoli, which is delicious and similar to <em>aam papad</em> but made of jackfruit.</p>
<p  >
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2  >
	4. Marari, Kerala</h2>
<p  >

	&nbsp;</p>
<p  >
	Kerala and its exotic beauty is an open secret. This vibrant state draws tourists from over the world who readily succumb to its magnificence. This time round, visit the lesser known treasures in Kerala like Marari Beach in Alleppey district. A sleepy town brimming with beauty on all four sides, this town is your paradisiacal retreat from the world. In Marari, you can stay at the <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com/hotels/marari_beach_resort-details-allepey.html" target="_blank">Marari Beach Resort</a>, a lavish property that subtly blends modern day comforts and a range of recreational activities with surrounding natural beauty.</p>
<h2  >
	5. Kovalam</h2>
<p  >
<img alt="kovalam beach holiday" height="587"  src="beaches/kovalam.jpg"  width="970" /></p>
<p  >
	Further down south from Marari, another rejuvenating beach holiday destination in Kerala is Kovalam. Basically a fishing village, Kovalam has garnered a lot of tourist attention in recent years and its famous Eve and Lighthouse beaches are pristine and clean lined with coconut trees of one side. You can opt for a highly rewarding cruise early in the morning with the fishermen or hire a surfboard and set on a mission to control the waves!</p>
<p  >
	This New Year, take you family to <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com/holidays-india/kovalam-travel-packages.html" target="_blank">Kovalam</a> for a rejuvenating and fun-filled beach holiday.</p>
